Embellished I Github Repository

This repository is for a drupal based bloggin type site that I originally set up at embellishedi.wordpress.com.

I created the site on Amazon Web Services, and am now attempting to migrate a clone of the site 
to a local testing environment on virtual box running the drupal based ubuntu distro "quickstart."

This is more of a learning experience with dev/live implementation and version control, so I am
trying to follow best practices as much as I know how.
